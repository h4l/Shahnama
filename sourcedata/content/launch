The full index will be available at all times, and we plan no major changes to the organisation of the information, the layout of which should remain familiar.</p><p>The first pages to move over are these introductory pages, which will allow us more flexibility in keeping you in touch with news and events, and allow us to provide more contextual information. We will later move on to improving the display of the catalogue itself. In the meantime you will see a hybrid site.</p><p>The purpose of this undertaking is as follows:</p><ul><li>to make the site quicker and more reliable,</li><li>to make the site compatible with more web devices and modern standards,</li><li>to fix long-standing bugs,</li><li>to make the site more discoverable by search engines,</li><li>to improve the layout of the pages to make the images themselves more prominent and,</li><li>to improve the search, presentation and workbook features.</li></ul><p>We anticipate this work will be complete by September 2011.</p><p>Dan Sheppard,&nbsp;July 2011.</p>",
